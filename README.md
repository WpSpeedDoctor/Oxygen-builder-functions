# Oxygen-builder-functions

Hi, this WordPress plugin is for Oxygen Builder users. As Oxygen Builder doesn't have natively a place where to insert code snippets, developers are using plugins like Code Snippets or placing code into the code block. I want to offer a plugin where already common snippets are available to use it right away. Snippets are sorted into modules and you can pass an argument from the back-end. As well you can turn on and off a module, run it only on back-end or front-end too.

### Installation: ###
Upload as a new plugin to WordPress
Activate
Settings -> Oxygen Functions

### Current modules: ###

Add editor query string

Back to top

Cookie consent popup window

Custom img src sizes

Disable WordPress default image lazy load

Exclude script from cf rocket loader

Favicon loader

Empty

Google analytics lite

Google tag manager

Image height and width

Lazy load bg images

Preload jquery

Remove redundant shortlink

Selective disable css js

Wp custom thumbnails


If you're using some snippets and you would like them to include them in this plugin, feel free to reach out at pixtweaks@protonmail.com. Any feedback is appreciated. 

Best Regards,
Jaro
